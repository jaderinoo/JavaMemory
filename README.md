The program will allow the user to modify certain aspects of the system, as well as all the use of a user input file
When asked to input a file, please include the full name. EX: input.txt
The input file is structured so that the user can test up to 6 different ranges of targets
the output will present the memory cache lines (Excluding 0's) as well as the hitratio and accesstime
The program uses algorithms to simulate cache memory
To compile the program, place the java file and input file into a new java project
